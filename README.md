# Tic-tac-toe

# PROBLEM
  Create a TicTacToe game
  (Consists of two players taking turn, a playing board, filling out the board in a number of ways to win the game)

# CASES
  1- Print out game board after each move
  2- Be able to start a new game when game ends on a draw or loss.

# SOLUTION
  1- Create a class to instantiate player
  2- Create a Tictactoe class to
    2.1- Playing board
    2.2- Turn
    2.3- Check if game is over and determine the winner
    2.4- Prompt user if they want to play again.

Compare to this article (http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Ruby) code needs a major refraction. Board needs to be a single array for simplicity sake.
